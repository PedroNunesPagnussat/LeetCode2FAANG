# üöÄ Leet-to-FAANG: My Journey from Boredom to Big Bucks 

## Why Did I Make This Repo?

So, you're probably wondering, "Why the heck did this person make a repo just for LeetCode answers?" ü§î

Well, you see, I found myself in a situation where I had too much free time and too few FAANG offers. What's a coder to do? Learn how to bake sourdough bread? Nah. Binge-watch Netflix? Not today. Then it hit me. Why not use this time to land a sweet, sweet job at a FAANG company? üí°

## What's Inside? üì¶

- LeetCode solutions that are _probably_ correct
- Explanations that I totally didn't copy from the LeetCode discussion boards
- Tips on how to sound like you know what you're talking about in interviews

## Languages Used üõ†

- Python because it's the Swiss Army knife for programmers
- SQL for problems that require me to pretend I understand databases
- Assembly it's not here, but if it was, I'd use it ironically

## How to Use This Repo ü§î

1. **Don't.** I mean, you can if you want to
2. If you still want to proceed, clone this repo like you'd clone a sheep‚Äîwithout questioning the moral implications.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LeetMeCode.git
    ```
3. Navigate to a problem folder.
4. Run the code and realize you could've solved it better.
5. Copy-paste my solution into LeetCode and hit that submit button.
4. Celebrate your correct answer.

## Final Thoughts

If you made it this far, congratulations. You've won absolutely nothing except the knowledge that someone, somewhere, was bored enough to write all this. Good day!
